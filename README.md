# Wide-angle-coverage-live-video-streaming-using-Raspberry-Pi
This is the Mini Project that has been carried out during the sixth semester of B.E in ECE.
The project aims at building a live video streaming model that has the capability to stream a wide area with almost 360 degree coverage.
Stepper motor was used to achieve the rotation and raspberry Pi camera module for capturing the video.
The streaming is hosted on a web page using HTTP Protocol.
This model facilitates ubiquitous streaming i.e it can be controlled by the respective user from any part of the world.
And this can also be used as a surveillance system as well.
